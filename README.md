# Rename Ships in World of Warships

A simple tool that allows you to replace strings in language files

With this you can turn your "Yamato" into a "Tomato"

The path to the language file for WoWs looks like this:
C:/Program Files/WOWS/res/texts/en/LC_MESSAGES/global.mo

Place the binary in the same folder of the .mo file, or specify the location when launching the application
